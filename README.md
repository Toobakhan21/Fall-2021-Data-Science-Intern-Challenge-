Question 1: Given some sample data, write a program to answer the following: click here to access the required data set

On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of $3145.13. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. 

a.	Think about what could be going wrong with our calculation. Think about a better way to evaluate this data. 
The calculation of AOV of $3145.13 is the average of total order_amount. A better way to evaluate this data could be if we find out order_amount/total_items for each order_id in data. AOV in this case is $387.74, which gives us amount per item.
b.	What metric would you report for this dataset?
Metric that I report for this data would be  total_items order per day.
c.	What is its value?
Value is 1465 total_items per day
